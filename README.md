# Introduction

A simple mod manager for Risk of Rain 2 build using Angular and Electron.

## Getting Started

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.

## Included Commands

| Command                    | Description                                                                                                 |

| `npm run build`            | Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder.                                                    |
| `npm run build:prod`       | Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder.                                   |
| `npm run electron:local`   | Builds your application and start electron                                                                  |
| `npm run electron:linux`   | Builds your application and creates an app consumable on linux system                                       |
| `npm run electron:windows` | On a Windows OS, builds your application and creates an app consumable in windows 32/64 bit systems         |
| `npm run electron:mac`     | On a MAC OS, builds your application and generates a `.app` file of your application that can be run on Mac |

**Your application is optimised. Only /dist folder and node dependencies are included in the executable.**

## You want to use a specific lib (like rxjs) in electron main thread ?

You can do this! Just by importing your library in npm dependencies (not devDependencies) with `npm install --save`. It will be loaded by electron during build phase and added to the final package. Then use your library by importing it in `main.ts` file. Easy no ?

## Browser mode

Maybe you want to execute the application in the browser with hot reload ? You can do it with `npm run ng:serve:web`.
Note that you can't use Electron or NodeJS native libraries in this case. Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of electron/Native libraries is done.
